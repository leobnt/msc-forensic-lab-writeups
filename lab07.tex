\section{Introduction}
In this Lab report, we will examine recorded traffic and console in- and output of a honeypot that has been ``hacked''.
The network traffic was recorded into a file in the well known pcap (\emph{p}acket \emph{cap}ture) format\footnote{\url{http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap3_man.html}}.

Using Wireshark on the pcap file, we can see, by selecting Statistics$\rightarrow$Summary,that the capture file identifies itself as being taken at 2009-01-14 16:24:07 and the capture lasts 11.5 days until 2009-01-26 10:05:01.
In total, 4323191 IP packets, which sum up to 673023355 bytes,   were sent.
% A breakdown can be found the protocol hierarchy in figure \FIXME{protcol hierarchy}

In the rest of this preliminary report, we will show how to obtain the commands the attacker issued and present an excerpt.
In the final report, we will analyse these commands and relate them with the traffic that was produced.
But as this is only the preliminary version, we will not do any analysis.

\section{Keyboard Capture File Examination}

The commands executed on the machine can be found in the given \texttt{serial.db} file.
This file can be parsed with a program such as SQLite\footnote{\url{http://sqlite.org/}}.

First we used the \texttt{.schema} SQL command on the file to get an idea of how the database was structured.
This told us that the database contains a single table called \texttt{spty}, which contains the fields, \texttt{id, msgtype, ptsname, cnt, msg} and \texttt{ts}.
Some of these can be easily explained, for example \texttt{id} is the id number of the entry and \texttt{ts} represents the date.
Some of the other fields would require further exploration.

Using the following SQL command we were able to extract the contents of the database to a text file to more easily understand the purpose of each field.

\begin{verbatim}
./sqlite3-3.6.23.bin serial.db "SELECT * FROM spty;" > output.txt
\end{verbatim}

The message field seemed to contain text that would normally be displayed in a terminal.
msgtype also seemed to be an interesting value.
It seemed to be an integer value of either 1, 2 or 3, but was appeared to be set to 2 whenever the message field was not blank.

To confirm this theory, we ran the following SQL queries:
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT * FROM spty where msgtype = 1 AND msg != '';
SELECT * FROM spty where msgtype = 2 AND msg != '';
SELECT * FROM spty where msgtype = 3 AND msg != '';
\end{verbatim}

As expected, only the second SQL command returned any data.
We then passed this data out to a text file and set about trying to tidy up its formatting.

We reasoned that lines concerning user input would contain the \texttt{\$} character (as this appears at the end of the command prompt in the shell).
We eliminated all unrelated lines by carrying out the following sed command on the file:
\begin{verbatim}
sed -n '/\$/,/\r/p' output.txt
\end{verbatim}

This left us with a list of user inputs, however each typed character appeared on a separate line.
Analysing the file with \texttt{xxd}, we noticed that \texttt{\textbackslash{}n} characters were used to separate typed characters whereas line breaks which we did not want to remove tended to use the \texttt{\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}r} character.
Taking advantage of this, we removed the \texttt{\textbackslash{}n}s with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
 awk '{printf("%s",$0)}' output.txt
 \end{verbatim}

 The output of this still contained the shell prompt, so we removed it with the following perl script:
% FIXME: Well, we could use lstlisting for that. But I'm too lazy atm
% But we shoul consider that for the final report
 \begin{verbatim}
 #!/usr/local/bin/perl

open(INPUTFILE, "<output.txt");
while(<INPUTFILE>)
{
        $line = $_;
        chomp($line);
        @words = split('\r',$line);
        foreach $word(@words)
        {
                ($start, $end) = split('\$ ',$word);
                print"$end\n";
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

This gives us the cleaned up output, some examples of which are shown below.
These contain some unusual characters such as \texttt{[K}, where the person using the terminal hit a function key such as backspace or one of the arrow keys.

\section{Conclusion}

We used wireshark to determine the start and end time of the complete packet capture.
We then used a combination of \texttt{sed}, \texttt{awk} and \texttt{perl} to extract the commands issued by the attacker from the SQLite database file.
Commands, that the attacker ran, were found and an excerpt was shown.
